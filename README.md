# Reinforcement Learning

## This repo is a work in progress.

This repository contains implementations of popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The aim is to make the code here as straightforward and modular as possible so that it is easy to train with custom backbone networks across various environments.

### Feature Extractors
This directory contains modular blocks from popular neural network architectures. 
- [Multi-Layer Perceptron](feature_extractors/mlp.py)
- [CNN](feature_extractors/cnn.py)

### Algorithms
This directory has all the RL algorithms. 
- [Deep Q-Learning](policies/DQN.md)

Other algorithms will be added shortly!
